			<h3>Types of Wastes</h3>
			<p>
				Generally, waste could be liquid or solid waste. Both of them could be hazardous. Liquid and solid waste types can also be grouped into organic, re-usable and recyclable waste.<br>
				Let us see some details below:<br><br></p>

			<h3>Solid Wastes</h3>

    			<div><h3>Medical or Clinical sources of wastes</h3></div>
    			<div><P>Wastes produced from health care facilities, <br>such as hospitals, clinics, surgical theaters, <br>veterinary hospitals, and labs are referred to <br>as medical/clinical waste. This includes surgical <br>items, pharmaceuticals, blood, body parts, wound <br>dressing materials, needles and syringes</P></div>

    			<div><h3>Organic waste</h3></div>
    			<div><P>Organic waste comes from plants or animals sources. <br>Commonly, they include food waste, fruit and vegetable peels,<br> flower trimmings and even dog poop can <br>be classified as organic waste. They are<br> iodegradable (this means they are easily broken <br>down by other organisms over time and turned into<br> manure). Many people turn their organic waste<br> into compost and use them in their gardens.</P></div>

    			<div><h3>Recyclable type:</h3></div>
    			<div><P>Recycling is processing used materials (waste) into new, useful products. <br>This is done to reduce the use of raw materials that would have been used. <br>Waste that can be potentially recycled is termed "Recyclable waste".</P></div>
